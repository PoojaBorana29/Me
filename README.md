# 👋 Welcome to My Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Hi! I’m **Pooja**, a Database Engineer transitioning into **Machine Learning and AI**.  

I have a strong foundation in **data engineering, statistics, and ML fundamentals**, with hands-on experience in **Generative AI, regression, classification, clustering, and EDA**.  

This portfolio showcases my **learning journey, practical projects, and technical skills** applied to real-world datasets.

## 📖 About Me

I started my career as a **Database Engineer**, building expertise in SQL, database management, and cloud platforms (Teradata, GCP). Driven by my passion for analytics, I transitioned into **Machine Learning and AI**, where I have:  

- Built a complete **RAG system** using LangChain, Gemini LLM & embeddings, and LanceDB to automate workload delay analysis  
- Worked on practical ML projects including **regression, KNN, clustering, and EDA**.
- Developed ML workflows on **cloud platforms (GCP, BigQuery, Vertex AI)**.
